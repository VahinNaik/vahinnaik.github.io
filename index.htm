                    I am 13 year old and currently studying at Pleasantville Public school. 
                    I am <mark class="bold"> empathetic, a deep thinker, persistent and curious</mark>. 
                    
                    Whenever I am working on something and I hit a road bump I always keep on going. Even if it takes me a long time to find a solution to my task at hand I go for it. 
                    <br><br>
                    One of my interests is making use of systems thinking to produce models that can be interacted with. This includes building/creating machines, programs and designing infrastructures with multiple parts and variables that come together and work in unison to produce desired results. 
                    
                    One more thing that is near and dear to my heart is Volunteering. 
                    <br><br>
                    I truly believe that God has given me a chance to help people and I should not waste it. I like a quote by Mother Teresa which says <mark class="bold">“Helping hands are better than Praying Lips”</mark>. With my school, classes, extra curricular activities, I am pretty busy. I still find time to volunteer at Vishnu Temple on a regular basis.

                    Covid stopped me doing so in person. So during  this time, I associated with SickKids Hospital. I participate in the GetLoud campaign to champion - the cause of  a new SickKids, built to serve future generations of our community. I raised $285 with the help of 4 team members for this noble cause. The campaign raised over $1.45 million! I am happy that I was able to contribute in some little way. I am inspired and doing it again in 2022!

                    I developed another hobby during the pandemic, and that is coding. I watched some YouTube videos on Python and started programming. I developed a few programs in Python that help students with their Math and French studies. I put it free to use (including the source code) on <a href="https://github.com/VahinNaik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="hlink2">GitHub</a> for people to use.
