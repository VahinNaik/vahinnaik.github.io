                    I am an <mark class="bold"> enthusiastic, self-motivated, ambitious, academically strong and determined</mark>
                    person with a deep interest in math, science, and technology. I am always fascinated to the field where complex math, science, and technology are used. My goal is to combine math, science, and technology and create tools that will 
                    benefit the environment, society, and human existence.
                    
                    Whenever I am working on something and I hit a road bump I always keep on going. Even if it takes me a long time to find a solution to my task at hand I go for it.

                    One more thing that is near and dear to my heart is Volunteering. 
                    <br><br>
                    I truly believe that God has given me a chance to help people and I should not waste it. I like a quote by Mother Teresa which says <mark class="bold">“Helping hands are better than Praying Lips”</mark>. With my school, classes, extra curricular activities, I am pretty busy. I still find time to volunteer at Vishnu Temple on a regular basis.

                    Covid stopped me doing so in person. So during  this time, I associated with SickKids Hospital. I participate in the GetLoud campaign to champion - the cause of  a new SickKids, built to serve future generations of our community. I raised $285 with the help of 4 team members for this noble cause.
                    <br><br>
                    I developed another hobby during the pandemic, and that is computer programming. I watched some YouTube videos on Python and started programming. I developed a few programs in Python that help students with their Math and French studies. I published it on <a href="https://github.com/VahinNaik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="hlink2">GitHub</a> for people to use. 
                    <br><br>
                    Earlier in 2021, I launched a new tutoring business. I later published an advertisement on <a href="https://www.kijiji.ca/v-view-details.html?adId=1583709846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="hlink2">Kijiji</a> and acquired my first student whom I am teaching Math. The experience taught me leadership, time management, teaching, and risk-taking, and it continues to do so. Furthermore, I am gaining expertise on expanding my network and many other skills for life experiences.
