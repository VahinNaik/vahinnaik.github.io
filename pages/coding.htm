                        In April of 2020, I was feeling stuck and bored amidst the lockdown. With no school, no friends, and no hope of going outside soon, I decided to take up a new hobby, coding. 
                        I had always been curious about this <b>"secret computer language"</b> and was not only having difficulty finding any time to pursue it but also found it kind of intimidating. 
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to try <b>Python</b>. This is because I found it is number 1 coding language and it has wide use from games to Artificial Intelligence and anything inbetween!
                        As soon as I watched first video on Python, I almost instantly realized that this was for me and that I needed to learn more. 
                        So on I went watching new tutorials, asking friends, and most importantly, experimenting by myself to see what I could come up with. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now in 2021, Iâ€™m glad that I chose to spend my time productively on that because now I have a new hobby that is both entertaining and useful.
